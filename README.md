# Introduction

Galaxy Conquest is an open source strategy game designed to run on any device anywhere. Inspired by the game of Risk and the Android game Age of Civilizations it features fun and easy to learn strategic gameplay on a galactic scale.

Galaxy Conquest is not yet complete so any contributions are welcome, whether they be reporting an issue or submitting a PR to fix a bug or balance the game (or even add a whole new feature). All contributors will be added to the credits of the finished product.

# Goals

This section details the goals of the project and how they can be achieved.

* **Truly Cross-Platform** Galaxy Conquest should run anywhere that you can run JavaScript and HTML (IE excluded). This will be achieved via use of tools such as NativeScript.

* **A+ Gameplay** Gameplay should be engaging and, deep unlike many mobile and web games which are considered by many to be shallow. Ads, paywalls, attempting to addict the player, and the like should be avoided like the plague. Gameplay should, most importantly, be fun, if it isn't fun then we've failed.
